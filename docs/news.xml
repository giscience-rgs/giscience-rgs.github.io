<p>Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) draws from across disciplinary domains in that it situates itself in data science, environmental science and geography. It incorporates multi-modal geospatial data to inform use cases in policy such as environmental degradation and disaster management.</p>
<p>This session aims to explore these and other cross-disciplinary interstices among big data, large language models, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and cartography. GIS education, which combines spatial analysis and cartographic design, represents a unique context in which Generative Artificial Intelligence tools can make a significant impact.</p>
<p>GIS education encompasses a variety of pedagogical approaches aimed at building both technical proficiency and spatial thinking (Duarte et al. 2022). Traditional methods are often complemented by laboratory-based learning, where students engage in hands-on exercises with GIS software like ArcGIS or QGIS, developing skills in spatial data manipulation, analysis, and visualization (Rickles and Ellul, 2015).</p>
<p>Contemporary approaches have integrated emerging technologies and pedagogies. For example, experiential learning incorporates fieldwork, enabling students to gather spatial data using GPS devices or drones. Additionally, the rise of WebGIS platforms and open data has democratized GIS education, making geospatial tools and datasets accessible to broader audiences (Ruibo, 2019).</p>
<p>This session is inspired by Muehlenhaus’s cartographically-focussed Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT). It is envisaged that papers will represent a diversity of methodological stances: qualitative studies and preliminary explorations are particularly encouraged.</p>
<p>Possible topics include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Descriptions and case studies of GeoAI and / or large language models to GIS and cartography / cartographic education;</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of how geographical epistemologies have shaped and / or been shaped by the application of (what might loosely be termed as) AI agents / AI tools;</p></li>
<li><p>Methodological approaches to such investigations; and</p></li>
<li><p>Defining and designing for the nurturing of literacies of GeoAI and the ethical implications of the use of IoT and Data Science in such investigations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Enquiries to Kenneth Y T Lim (voyager@mac.com / kenneth.lim@nie.edu.sg) are welcome.</p>

<p>Human interaction with urban environments has been a central topic in urban studies (Pattison, 1964). Geographers have explored the interactions between humans and their surroundings, investigating how individuals adapt to, modify, and influence their environment, while also considering how environmental factors shape human activities and cultural practices (Tuan, 1975). Recent advancements in GIS technologies, coupled with the increasing availability of diverse datasets—such as remote sensing imagery, geotagged search engine data, social media content, mobility data, and street-level imagery—have enabled novel approaches to studying place identity, residents’ mobility, and social perceptions (e.g., sense of belonging, community emotions).Moreover, the use of computational techniques, including machine learning and deep learning, has significantly improved our ability to interpret and model complex interactions.</p>
<p>This session aims to be a forum for discussing the integration of multi-source geospatial big data and GIS techniques to advance our understanding of human-urban interaction. We welcome submissions that explore innovative methodologies, theoretical perspectives, and practical applications in this field. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-Source Geospatial Big Data for Extracting Human Behaviour/ Perception
<ul>
<li>Remote sensing</li>
<li>Street-level imagery</li>
<li>Social media data</li>
<li>Mobility data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GIS, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning for Human-Environment Interaction
<ul>
<li>Human mobility</li>
<li>Human perception and social sensing</li>
<li>Social interaction</li>
<li>Transit-Oriented Development (TOD)</li>

<section id="call-for-abstracts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="call-for-abstracts">Call for abstracts</h2>
<p>Over the past decade, significant advancements in deep learning have launched a new “AI spring,” reigniting research interest in artificial intelligence within GIScience and quantitative geography. While large language models have been making headlines in newspapers worldwide, a broader range of foundation models and architectures (e.g., CNN, GNN GAN, LSTM, Transformer) have sparked new work in GeoAI (Janowicz et al., 2020; De Sabbata et al., 2023, Hu et al.&nbsp;2024, Mai et al., 2025). For example, vision models have been applied to street-view imagery to explore urban perceptions and infer socio-economic outcomes (Biljecki and Ito 2021;&nbsp;Law et al 2019). The transformer architecture has been used for natural language processing (Berragan et al., 2023), image analysis and machine vision (Li et al, 2022). Graph neural networks have been employed for geodemographic classifications and question-answering with geographic knowledge graphs (De Sabbata and Liu, 2023; Mai et al, 2020).<em>&nbsp;</em>More recently, Geo foundation models have emerged, leveraging large-scale geographic data to support multi-modal geographic analysis.</p>
<p>This session aims to be a forum to discuss advances, opportunities, and challenges of the use of GeoAI in quantitative geography and geographic information science, showcasing the latest advancements in GeoAI theories, methods and applications within the realm of quantitative geographic studies.&nbsp;We invite submissions that engage with the research agenda recently proposed by Nelson et al.&nbsp;(2024)&nbsp;and focus on but not limited to the topics below:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>GeoAI methods, including but not limited to</em>

<p><strong>Accessibility and essential travel: public transport and the mobility of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic</strong><br>
by Alfie Long</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic, and numerous lockdowns and restrictions, resulted in a significant decline in public transport demand and the replacement of usual out-of-home activities with online equivalents. Whilst restrictions have since eased in the UK, a simple return to pre-pandemic travel behaviour is unlikely. In order to support public transport authorities and operators in providing an inclusive public transport system that meets the needs of users, the field requires continued research into changes in public transport patronage by different population groups throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
Using smart card travel data, we analyse demand for bus services during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the groups of the older population that continued to use public transport services during lockdown periods and that quickly returned to public transport when restrictions were eased. We compare these trends according to demographic characteristics of passengers as well as accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Alfie Long is currently a PhD Student at UCL Department of Geography. His research is aimed at developing existing public transport big data infrastructure into simpler data formats that can be used to analyse the social equity of public transport mobilities.</p>
<p><strong>Analysing the Impacts of Lockdown Restrictions on the London Bicycle Sharing System</strong><br>
By James Todd</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused large scale disruptions to the daily lives of billions around the world. This is primarily a result of the implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI), in its various forms, by local and national governing bodies to help minimise the spread of the virus. In the most severe cases lockdown restrictions were imposed on populations, forcing them to quarantine within their own homes except for limited and specific purposes. Within this analysis we aim to quantify the impacts of these lockdown restrictions on the activity patterns observed within the docked London bicycle sharing system. Employing network and statistical analysis methods this work presents novel insights into the changes in cycling behaviour observed spatially, temporally and at a system-wide scale.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: James is currently an Associate Lecturer and Ph.D.&nbsp;student within the Department of Geography at UCL. His research aims to analyse the utility and validity of new urban mobility data sources in helping to understand movement trends for Smart City applications. Over the past few years, James has worked extensively with bicycle sharing system data from over 600 cities, exploiting dock capacity information to create comparative heuristics.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Somayeh Dodge’s&nbsp;<a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a>&nbsp;is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/cM3qIOOKkMU</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Movement patterns are the results of complex behaviors and processes which drive individuals’ movement in social and ecological systems. These patterns shape urban and natural ecosystem dynamics, structure human and wildlife social networks, and are instrumental to understanding human and wildlife’s behavioral responses to a changing environment. Ubiquitous tracking and the increasing access to movement data in both trajectory forms and aggregate indices have generated a tremendous interest in using data-driven approaches to model and understand behavioral responses to disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and to develop mitigation strategies. In this presentation, I argue for a human-centered approach to movement data science to analyze and map human responses to environmental disruptions.</p>

<p>Sarah Battersby’s&nbsp;<a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a>&nbsp;is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/NWQRyAbR8LU</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: There are many online and desktop tools designed to make mapping easy for anyone who wants to explore, analyze, and communicate the spatial patterns in their data. However, as geographers seem to enjoy reminding everyone, “spatial is special,” and the decision making that goes into finding, understanding, and communicating spatial patterns can be complex. In this presentation, I will address some of the technical, design, and analytics challenges that we face in designing self-service spatial analytics tools, as well as consideration of the broader challenges of how people think about maps that make the whole process more challenging (and more interesting).</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Sarah Battersby, Tableau, <a href="https://twitter.com/mapsoverlord?lang=en"><span class="citation" data-cites="mapsOverlord">@mapsOverlord</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Sarah Battersby is a Principal Research Scientist on the Tableau Research team at Salesforce. Sarah’s primary area of focus is cartography, with an emphasis on cognition.

  <title>Video • Taylor Shelton: “Mapping the Opaque: Embracing Fuzziness, Uncovering Inequalities”</title>
  <link>https://giscience-rgs.github.io/posts/video-taylor-shelton-mapping-the-opaque-embracing-fuzziness-uncovering-inequalities/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Taylor Shelton’s&nbsp;<a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a>&nbsp;is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/Z-FeU_SiQIM</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the continued growth of data collected about any number of social and spatial phenomena, as well as new analytical techniques to make sense of such data, many processes of particular interest to geographers remain resistant to datafication, quantification and spatial visualization. But the inherent fuzziness associated with trying to quantify and map emerging phenomena for whom precise data does not exist does not mean that using what data we do have is useless or should be avoided. Instead, as this presentation will argue, if we’re interested in uncovering the multifaceted inequalities that characterize our present moment, we must begin to embrace the inherent fuzziness of these new, partial data sources and attempt to make sense out of their partial perspective. In order to demonstrate the value of this disposition towards embracing the fuzziness of data, this presentation will discuss findings from two recent research projects focused on mapping otherwise opaque socio-spatial processes: (1) quantifying the presence of emerging forms of regionally-specific housing speculation in college towns of the American South that have previously gone unstudied, and (2) using geotagged social media data to develop more relational understandings of gentrification that focus on changes in the relationships between different people and neighborhoods in the city over time, rather than on the inherent or internal characteristics of neighborhoods themselves. Ultimately, this presentation points towards the need for continued experimentations with emerging data sources, analytical techniques and geographic theories to better understand the ever-evolving landscape of socio-spatial inequality in the world today.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Dr.&nbsp;Taylor Shelton is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Georgia State University. Working at the intersection of critical human geography and geographic information science, Dr.&nbsp;Shelton is interested in how urban spaces and social inequalities are represented, reproduced and contested through maps and data. In particular, his work focuses on using mapping and data visualization to develop alternative understandings of urban inequalities, especially in relation to issues of housing speculation, property ownership and neighborhood segregation. Prior to joining Georgia State in 2020, Dr.&nbsp;Shelton held appointments at Mississippi State University, the University of Kentucky and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before that, Dr.&nbsp;Shelton earned BA and MA degrees in geography from the University of Kentucky and his PhD from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University.

  <title>Video • Ate Poorthuis: “GIScience &amp; Network Analysis: A Happy Reunion?”</title>
  <link>https://giscience-rgs.github.io/posts/video-ate-poorthuis-giscience-network-analysis-a-happy-reunion/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Ate Poorthuis’ <a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a> is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/KHgjcrGmTnk</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>After having grown into distinctly different sub-disciplines in the latter half of the 20th century, quantitative geography is now increasingly adopting methods and techniques from network analysis. Network analysis provides a different perspective on the world, through relations between people and places instead of the abstract space of GIS. This provides an exciting opportunity to break free(er) from the well-known constraints of the Cartesian grid common to most spatial techniques. Thrust forward by new types of geographical data and computational power, this combination of spatial + network analysis is especially incisive when applied to analyses of urban processes. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the diverging and converging histories of spatial and network analysis. I will then illustrate the current use and potential of network analytical methods in geography by drawing on my recent work on urban neighborhoods and systems.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Ate Poorthuis, KU Leuven, <a href="http://atepoorthuis.com">atepoorthuis.com</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/atepoorthuis?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"><span class="citation" data-cites="atepoorthuis">@atepoorthuis</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Ate Poorthuis is an Assistant Professor of Big Data and Human-Environment Systems in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at KU Leuven. His research explores the possibilities and limitations of big data, through quantitative analysis and visualization, to better understand how our cities work. He has particular interest in the practical application of these academic insights within urban planning and policy.

<p>Sarah Battersby is a Principal Research Scientist on the Tableau Research team at Salesforce.&nbsp; Sarah’s primary area of focus is cartography, with an emphasis on cognition. Her work emphasizes how to help everyone visualize and use spatial information more effectively – no advanced degree in geospatial required. &nbsp;Sarah holds a PhD in GIScience from the University of California at Santa Barbara. She is a member of the International Cartographic Association Commission on Map Projections, and is a Past President of the Cartography and Geographic Information Society (CaGIS).

<p>Andrew’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL8vJuDIl-U&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup">GIScience webinar</a> is now online!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL8vJuDIl-U&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;The beginning of this century marked a milestone in human history. For the first time, more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas. This trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future with 6.7 billion people projected to live in cities by 2050. This rapid urbanization will place unprecedented pressures on urban systems and their ability to provide basic of services. To plan for this future, we need to better understand the inherent complexity of urban systems from social, economic and environmental perspectives. In this talk, I will explore how such understanding can be gained through the lens of computational social science (CSS): the interdisciplinary science of complex social systems and their investigation through computational modeling (e.g.&nbsp;agent-based models) and related techniques. Through a series of example applications, I will demonstrate how new forms of geographical data (e.g.&nbsp;crowdsourced, social media etc.) not only provide us with a novel way of analyzing urban environments but how such data can be integrated into geographically explicit agent-based models. In addition, I will highlight that by focusing on individual, or groups of individuals, leads to more aggregate patterns emerging and show how model outcomes can be validated by such datasets. After these demonstrations, I will outline the challenges associated with this program of research, as using such data is not without its difficulties. Together, this work provides a brief overview of the current state of analyzing and modeling urban environments through the lens of CSS.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> After having grown into distinctly different sub-disciplines in the latter half of the 20th&nbsp;century, quantitative geography is now increasingly adopting methods and techniques from network analysis. Network analysis provides a different perspective on the world, through&nbsp;<em>relations</em>&nbsp;between people and places instead of the abstract space of GIS. This provides an exciting opportunity to break free(er) from the well-known constraints of the Cartesian grid common to most spatial techniques. Thrust forward by new types of geographical data and computational power, this combination of spatial + network analysis is especially incisive when applied to analyses of urban processes. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the diverging and converging histories of spatial and network analysis. I will then illustrate the current use and potential of network analytical methods in geography by drawing on my recent work on urban neighborhoods and systems.</p>
<p>Ate Poorthuis&nbsp;is an Assistant Professor of Big Data and Human-Environment Systems in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at KU Leuven. His research explores the possibilities and limitations of big data, through quantitative analysis and visualization, to better understand how our cities work. He has particular interest in the practical application of these academic insights within urban planning and policy.

<p>Anita’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRE9Zl7jpUA&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup">GIScience webinar</a> is now online!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRE9Zl7jpUA&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The potential of Big Data for understanding human mobility patterns and other complex phenomena in transportation and movement research is significant. Many contemporary Big Data sources have clear spatiotemporal dimensions. However, Big Spatiotemporal Data is usually messy and presents numerous challenges to researchers and analysts trying to extract information and knowledge. Exploratory data analysis tools for massive movement data are necessary to gain an understanding of our data, its biases and messiness and how they might affect our analyses. This talk presents methods for the exploration of movement patterns in massive quasi-continuous GPS tracking datasets, with examples focusing on international maritime vessel movements.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Anita Graser is a researcher, open source GIS developer, and author. She works at the Austrian Institute of Technology in Vienna, teaches Python for QGIS at UNIGIS Salzburg and serves on the QGIS project steering committee. She has published several books about QGIS, including “<a href="https://anitagraser.com/2016/04/15/learning-qgis-3rd-ed-discounts/">Learning QGIS</a>” and “<a href="https://locatepress.com/qmd2">QGIS Map Design</a>”. Her latest project is&nbsp;<a href="https://anitagraser.github.io/movingpandas/">MovingPandas</a>, a Python library for analyzing movement data.
