<p><strong>Accessibility and essential travel: public transport and the mobility of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic</strong><br>
by Alfie Long</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic, and numerous lockdowns and restrictions, resulted in a significant decline in public transport demand and the replacement of usual out-of-home activities with online equivalents. Whilst restrictions have since eased in the UK, a simple return to pre-pandemic travel behaviour is unlikely. In order to support public transport authorities and operators in providing an inclusive public transport system that meets the needs of users, the field requires continued research into changes in public transport patronage by different population groups throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
Using smart card travel data, we analyse demand for bus services during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the groups of the older population that continued to use public transport services during lockdown periods and that quickly returned to public transport when restrictions were eased. We compare these trends according to demographic characteristics of passengers as well as accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: Alfie Long is currently a PhD Student at UCL Department of Geography. His research is aimed at developing existing public transport big data infrastructure into simpler data formats that can be used to analyse the social equity of public transport mobilities.</p>
<p><strong>Analysing the Impacts of Lockdown Restrictions on the London Bicycle Sharing System</strong><br>
By James Todd</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused large scale disruptions to the daily lives of billions around the world. This is primarily a result of the implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI), in its various forms, by local and national governing bodies to help minimise the spread of the virus. In the most severe cases lockdown restrictions were imposed on populations, forcing them to quarantine within their own homes except for limited and specific purposes. Within this analysis we aim to quantify the impacts of these lockdown restrictions on the activity patterns observed within the docked London bicycle sharing system. Employing network and statistical analysis methods this work presents novel insights into the changes in cycling behaviour observed spatially, temporally and at a system-wide scale.</p>
<p><strong>Biography</strong>: James is currently an Associate Lecturer and Ph.D.&nbsp;student within the Department of Geography at UCL. His research aims to analyse the utility and validity of new urban mobility data sources in helping to understand movement trends for Smart City applications. Over the past few years, James has worked extensively with bicycle sharing system data from over 600 cities, exploiting dock capacity information to create comparative heuristics.</p>

  <title>Video • Somayeh Dodge: “ Analyzing and Mapping Movement Responses to Environmental Disruptions”</title>
  <link>https://giscience-rgs.github.io/posts/video-somayeh-dodge-analyzing-and-mapping-movement-responses-to-environmental-disruptions/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Somayeh Dodge’s&nbsp;<a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a>&nbsp;is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/cM3qIOOKkMU</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Movement patterns are the results of complex behaviors and processes which drive individuals’ movement in social and ecological systems. These patterns shape urban and natural ecosystem dynamics, structure human and wildlife social networks, and are instrumental to understanding human and wildlife’s behavioral responses to a changing environment. Ubiquitous tracking and the increasing access to movement data in both trajectory forms and aggregate indices have generated a tremendous interest in using data-driven approaches to model and understand behavioral responses to disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and to develop mitigation strategies. In this presentation, I argue for a human-centered approach to movement data science to analyze and map human responses to environmental disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Somayeh Dodge, University of California, Santa Barbara, <a href="http://www.somayehdodge.info">somayehdodge.info</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/smayadodge"><span class="citation" data-cites="smayadodge">@smayadodge</span></a>.</p>

  <title>Video • Sarah Battersby : “One Map to Rule Them All: Spatial in the World of Self-service Analytics”</title>
  <link>https://giscience-rgs.github.io/posts/video-sarah-battersby-one-map-to-rule-them-all-spatial-in-the-world-of-self-service-analytics/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Sarah Battersby’s&nbsp;<a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a>&nbsp;is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/NWQRyAbR8LU</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: There are many online and desktop tools designed to make mapping easy for anyone who wants to explore, analyze, and communicate the spatial patterns in their data. However, as geographers seem to enjoy reminding everyone, “spatial is special,” and the decision making that goes into finding, understanding, and communicating spatial patterns can be complex. In this presentation, I will address some of the technical, design, and analytics challenges that we face in designing self-service spatial analytics tools, as well as consideration of the broader challenges of how people think about maps that make the whole process more challenging (and more interesting).</p>
<p><strong>Speaker</strong>: Sarah Battersby, Tableau, <a href="https://twitter.com/mapsoverlord?lang=en"><span class="citation" data-cites="mapsOverlord">@mapsOverlord</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong>: Sarah Battersby is a Principal Research Scientist on the Tableau Research team at Salesforce. Sarah’s primary area of focus is cartography, with an emphasis on cognition. Her work emphasizes how to help everyone visualize and use spatial information more effectively – no advanced degree in geospatial required. Sarah holds a PhD in GIScience from the University of California at Santa Barbara. She is a member of the International Cartographic Association Commission on Map Projections, and is a Past President of the Cartography and Geographic Information Society (CaGIS).

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Movement patterns are the results of complex behaviors and processes which drive individuals’ movement in social and ecological systems. These patterns shape urban and natural ecosystem dynamics, structure human and wildlife social networks, and are instrumental to understanding human and wildlife’s behavioral responses to a changing environment. Ubiquitous tracking and the increasing access to movement data in both trajectory forms and aggregate indices have generated a tremendous interest in using data-driven approaches to model and understand behavioral responses to disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and to develop mitigation strategies. In this presentation, I argue for a human-centered approach to movement data science to analyze and map human responses to environmental disruptions.</p>

<p>Taylor Shelton’s&nbsp;<a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a>&nbsp;is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/Z-FeU_SiQIM</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite the continued growth of data collected about any number of social and spatial phenomena, as well as new analytical techniques to make sense of such data, many processes of particular interest to geographers remain resistant to datafication, quantification and spatial visualization. But the inherent fuzziness associated with trying to quantify and map emerging phenomena for whom precise data does not exist does not mean that using what data we do have is useless or should be avoided. Instead, as this presentation will argue, if we’re interested in uncovering the multifaceted inequalities that characterize our present moment, we must begin to embrace the inherent fuzziness of these new, partial data sources and attempt to make sense out of their partial perspective. In order to demonstrate the value of this disposition towards embracing the fuzziness of data, this presentation will discuss findings from two recent research projects focused on mapping otherwise opaque socio-spatial processes: (1) quantifying the presence of emerging forms of regionally-specific housing speculation in college towns of the American South that have previously gone unstudied, and (2) using geotagged social media data to develop more relational understandings of gentrification that focus on changes in the relationships between different people and neighborhoods in the city over time, rather than on the inherent or internal characteristics of neighborhoods themselves. Ultimately, this presentation points towards the need for continued experimentations with emerging data sources, analytical techniques and geographic theories to better understand the ever-evolving landscape of socio-spatial inequality in the world today.</p>

  <title>Video • Ate Poorthuis: “GIScience &amp; Network Analysis: A Happy Reunion?”</title>

<p>Ate Poorthuis’ <a href="https://geoinfo.science/webinars/">GIScience webinar</a> is now online!</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/KHgjcrGmTnk</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>After having grown into distinctly different sub-disciplines in the latter half of the 20th century, quantitative geography is now increasingly adopting methods and techniques from network analysis. Network analysis provides a different perspective on the world, through relations between people and places instead of the abstract space of GIS. This provides an exciting opportunity to break free(er) from the well-known constraints of the Cartesian grid common to most spatial techniques. Thrust forward by new types of geographical data and computational power, this combination of spatial + network analysis is especially incisive when applied to analyses of urban processes. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the diverging and converging histories of spatial and network analysis. I will then illustrate the current use and potential of network analytical methods in geography by drawing on my recent work on urban neighborhoods and systems.</p>

<p><strong>Title:</strong> One Map to Rule Them All: Spatial in the World of Self-service Analytics. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong>&nbsp;Wednesday 5th May 2021, 17:00 pm UK / 16:00 pm UTC</p>
<p><strong>Register at:</strong> <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/rgs-ibg-giscience-webinar-spatial-in-the-world-of-self-service-analytics-tickets-151306115665">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/rgs-ibg-giscience-webinar-spatial-in-the-world-of-self-service-analytics-tickets-151306115665</a></p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: There are many online and desktop tools designed to make mapping easy for&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>&nbsp;who wants to explore, analyze, and communicate the spatial patterns in their data. However, as geographers seem to enjoy reminding everyone, “spatial is special,” and the decision making that goes into finding, understanding, and communicating spatial patterns can be complex.&nbsp; In this presentation, I will address some of the technical, design, and analytics challenges that we face in designing self-service spatial analytics tools, as well as consideration of the broader challenges of how&nbsp;<em>people</em>&nbsp;think about maps that make the whole process more challenging (and more interesting).</p>
<p>Sarah Battersby is a Principal Research Scientist on the Tableau Research team at Salesforce.&nbsp; Sarah’s primary area of focus is cartography, with an emphasis on cognition. Her work emphasizes how to help everyone visualize and use spatial information more effectively – no advanced degree in geospatial required. &nbsp;Sarah holds a PhD in GIScience from the University of California at Santa Barbara. She is a member of the International Cartographic Association Commission on Map Projections, and is a Past President of the Cartography and Geographic Information Society (CaGIS).

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Andrew’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL8vJuDIl-U&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup">GIScience webinar</a> is now online!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL8vJuDIl-U&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>&nbsp;The beginning of this century marked a milestone in human history. For the first time, more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas. This trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future with 6.7 billion people projected to live in cities by 2050. This rapid urbanization will place unprecedented pressures on urban systems and their ability to provide basic of services. To plan for this future, we need to better understand the inherent complexity of urban systems from social, economic and environmental perspectives. In this talk, I will explore how such understanding can be gained through the lens of computational social science (CSS): the interdisciplinary science of complex social systems and their investigation through computational modeling (e.g.&nbsp;agent-based models) and related techniques. Through a series of example applications, I will demonstrate how new forms of geographical data (e.g.&nbsp;crowdsourced, social media etc.) not only provide us with a novel way of analyzing urban environments but how such data can be integrated into geographically explicit agent-based models. In addition, I will highlight that by focusing on individual, or groups of individuals, leads to more aggregate patterns emerging and show how model outcomes can be validated by such datasets. After these demonstrations, I will outline the challenges associated with this program of research, as using such data is not without its difficulties. Together, this work provides a brief overview of the current state of analyzing and modeling urban environments through the lens of CSS.</p>

<p>Anita’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRE9Zl7jpUA&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup">GIScience webinar</a> is now online!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRE9Zl7jpUA&amp;ab_channel=RGS-IBGGIScienceResearchGroup</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The potential of Big Data for understanding human mobility patterns and other complex phenomena in transportation and movement research is significant. Many contemporary Big Data sources have clear spatiotemporal dimensions. However, Big Spatiotemporal Data is usually messy and presents numerous challenges to researchers and analysts trying to extract information and knowledge. Exploratory data analysis tools for massive movement data are necessary to gain an understanding of our data, its biases and messiness and how they might affect our analyses. This talk presents methods for the exploration of movement patterns in massive quasi-continuous GPS tracking datasets, with examples focusing on international maritime vessel movements.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Discovering and describing spatial patterns is an important element of many geographical studies with spatial patterns being related to ecological and sociological processes. While spatial patterns are often clearly visible on maps, it is not easy to unequivocally decide if two areas are much alike or delineate regions with similar patterns. In this talk, Jakub Nowosad will present a set of consistent ideas on how spatial patterns can be described and analyzed, with a focus on categorical raster data. The core idea is to divide raster data consisting of cells having simple content (a single value) into a large number of smaller areas, and then characterize each area using a statistical description of a pattern - a spatial signature. Spatial signatures are multi-values representations of spatial composition and configuration, and therefore can be compared using a large number of existing distance or dissimilarity measures. This enables spatial analysis such as search, change detection, clustering, and segmentation. During this talk, a number of real-life examples of finding similar spatial patterns, detecting changes over time, and grouping areas with homogeneous patterns for regional, continental, and global scales will be shown.</p>
