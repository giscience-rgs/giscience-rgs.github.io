With the increased availability of these data, it is becoming apparent that the value of “big data” lies not necessarily in its size, but in its heterogeneity.  As recent progress in data analytics and ambient intelligence is met with sensor-enabled mobile technology, geographic information science has pushed beyond “spatial” to incorporate non-explicitly geospatial contextual data.  This heterogeneous “digital exhaust” has led us to develop computational, data-driven models of human behaviour and take a multi-dimensional approach to investigating “place” and the activities people carry out at places.  In this talk, Prof. Grant McKenzie will champion this move towards Platial data science through his research on reverse geocoding, language-based tourist attraction similarity, and shared micro-mobility services."

Many contemporary Big Data sources have clear spatiotemporal dimensions. However, Big Spatiotemporal Data is usually messy and presents numerous challenges to researchers and analysts trying to extract information and knowledge. Exploratory data analysis tools for massive movement data are necessary to gain an understanding of our data, its biases and messiness and how they might affect our analyses. This talk presents methods for the exploration of movement patterns in massive quasi-continuous GPS tracking datasets, with examples focusing on international maritime vessel movements.\nAnita Graser is a researcher, open source GIS developer, and author. She works at the Austrian Institute of Technology in Vienna, teaches Python for QGIS at UNIGIS Salzburg and serves on the QGIS project steering committee.

For the first time, more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas. This trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future with 6.7 billion people projected to live in cities by 2050. This rapid urbanization will place unprecedented pressures on urban systems and their ability to provide basic of services. To plan for this future, we need to better understand the inherent complexity of urban systems from social, economic and environmental perspectives. In this talk, I will explore how such understanding can be gained through the lens of computational social science (CSS): the interdisciplinary science of complex social systems and their investigation through computational modeling (e.g. agent-based models) and related techniques. Through a series of example applications, I will demonstrate how new forms of geographical data (e.g. crowdsourced, social media etc.) not only provide us with a novel way of analyzing urban environments but how such data can be integrated into geographically explicit agent-based models. In addition, I will highlight that by focusing on individual, or groups of individuals, leads to more aggregate patterns emerging and show how model outcomes can be validated by such datasets. After these demonstrations, I will outline the challenges associated with this program of research, as using such data is not without its difficulties. Together, this work provides a brief overview of the current state of analyzing and modeling urban environments through the lens of CSS.\nAndrew Crooks is a Professor at the University at Buffalo within the Department of Geography and a faculty member in the RENEW Institute. His research interests relate to exploring, understanding and the communication of the natural and socio-economic environments using geographical information systems (GIS), social network analysis (SNA), and Agent-based modeling methodologies. He is also a lead author of “Agent-based Modelling and Geographical Information Systems: A Practical Primer” which explains how to design and build ABM and how to link the models to Geographical Information Systems.

But the inherent fuzziness associated with trying to quantify and map emerging phenomena for whom precise data does not exist does not mean that using what data we do have is useless or should be avoided. Instead, as this presentation will argue, if we’re interested in uncovering the multifaceted inequalities that characterize our present moment, we must begin to embrace the inherent fuzziness of these new, partial data sources and attempt to make sense out of their partial perspective. In order to demonstrate the value of this disposition towards embracing the fuzziness of data, this presentation will discuss findings from two recent research projects focused on mapping otherwise opaque socio-spatial processes: (1) quantifying the presence of emerging forms of regionally-specific housing speculation in college towns of the American South that have previously gone unstudied, and (2) using geotagged social media data to develop more relational understandings of gentrification that focus on changes in the relationships between different people and neighborhoods in the city over time, rather than on the inherent or internal characteristics of neighborhoods themselves. Ultimately, this presentation points towards the need for continued experimentations with emerging data sources, analytical techniques and geographic theories to better understand the ever-evolving landscape of socio-spatial inequality in the world today.\nDr. Taylor Shelton is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Georgia State University. Working at the intersection of critical human geography and geographic information science, Dr. Shelton is interested in how urban spaces and social inequalities are represented, reproduced and contested through maps and data. In particular, his work focuses on using mapping and data visualization to develop alternative understandings of urban inequalities, especially in relation to issues of housing speculation, property ownership and neighborhood segregation.\nPrior to joining Georgia State in 2020, Dr. Shelton held appointments at Mississippi State University, the University of Kentucky and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before that, Dr. Shelton earned BA and MA degrees in geography from the University of Kentucky and his PhD from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University.

While spatial patterns are often clearly visible on maps, it is not easy to unequivocally decide if two areas are much alike or delineate regions with similar patterns. In this talk, Jakub Nowosad will present a set of consistent ideas on how spatial patterns can be described and analyzed, with a focus on categorical raster data. The core idea is to divide raster data consisting of cells having simple content (a single value) into a large number of smaller areas, and then characterize each area using a statistical description of a pattern - a spatial signature. Spatial signatures are multi-values representations of spatial composition and configuration, and therefore can be compared using a large number of existing distance or dissimilarity measures. This enables spatial analysis such as search, change detection, clustering, and segmentation. During this talk, a number of real-life examples of finding similar spatial patterns, detecting changes over time, and grouping areas with homogeneous patterns for regional, continental, and global scales will be shown.\nSpeaker: Dr Jakub Nowosad, Assistant Professor, Institute of Geoecology and Geoinformation, Adam Mickiewicz University, https://nowosad.github.io/​, @jakub_nowosad Host: Stefano De Sabbata Bio: Dr. Jakub Nowosad is an assistant professor in the Institute of Geoecology and Geoinformation at Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland.

Many contemporary Big Data sources have clear spatiotemporal dimensions. However, Big Spatiotemporal Data is usually messy and presents numerous challenges to researchers and analysts trying to extract information and knowledge. Exploratory data analysis tools for massive movement data are necessary to gain an understanding of our data, its biases and messiness and how they might affect our analyses. This talk presents methods for the exploration of movement patterns in massive quasi-continuous GPS tracking datasets, with examples focusing on international maritime vessel movements.\nSpeaker: Anita Graser is a researcher, open source GIS developer, and author.

For the first time, more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas. This trend is expected to continue into the foreseeable future with 6.7 billion people projected to live in cities by 2050. This rapid urbanization will place unprecedented pressures on urban systems and their ability to provide basic of services. To plan for this future, we need to better understand the inherent complexity of urban systems from social, economic and environmental perspectives. In this talk, I will explore how such understanding can be gained through the lens of computational social science (CSS): the interdisciplinary science of complex social systems and their investigation through computational modeling (e.g. agent-based models) and related techniques. Through a series of example applications, I will demonstrate how new forms of geographical data (e.g. crowdsourced, social media etc.) not only provide us with a novel way of analyzing urban environments but how such data can be integrated into geographically explicit agent-based models. In addition, I will highlight that by focusing on individual, or groups of individuals, leads to more aggregate patterns emerging and show how model outcomes can be validated by such datasets. After these demonstrations, I will outline the challenges associated with this program of research, as using such data is not without its difficulties. Together, this work provides a brief overview of the current state of analyzing and modeling urban environments through the lens of CSS.\nSpeaker: Andrew Crooks is a Professor at the University at Buffalo within the Department of Geography and a faculty member in the RENEW Institute.

Network analysis provides a different perspective on the world, through relations between people and places instead of the abstract space of GIS. This provides an exciting opportunity to break free(er) from the well-known constraints of the Cartesian grid common to most spatial techniques. Thrust forward by new types of geographical data and computational power, this combination of spatial + network analysis is especially incisive when applied to analyses of urban processes. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the diverging and converging histories of spatial and network analysis. I will then illustrate the current use and potential of network analytical methods in geography by drawing on my recent work on urban neighborhoods and systems.\nSpeaker: Ate Poorthuis, KU Leuven, atepoorthuis.com , @atepoorthuis.\nBio: Ate Poorthuis is an Assistant Professor of Big Data and Human-Environment Systems in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at KU Leuven.

    "text": "Taylor Shelton’s GIScience webinar is now online!\nhttps://youtu.be/Z-FeU_SiQIM\nAbstract: Despite the continued growth of data collected about any number of social and spatial phenomena, as well as new analytical techniques to make sense of such data, many processes of particular interest to geographers remain resistant to datafication, quantification and spatial visualization. But the inherent fuzziness associated with trying to quantify and map emerging phenomena for whom precise data does not exist does not mean that using what data we do have is useless or should be avoided. Instead, as this presentation will argue, if we’re interested in uncovering the multifaceted inequalities that characterize our present moment, we must begin to embrace the inherent fuzziness of these new, partial data sources and attempt to make sense out of their partial perspective. In order to demonstrate the value of this disposition towards embracing the fuzziness of data, this presentation will discuss findings from two recent research projects focused on mapping otherwise opaque socio-spatial processes: (1) quantifying the presence of emerging forms of regionally-specific housing speculation in college towns of the American South that have previously gone unstudied, and (2) using geotagged social media data to develop more relational understandings of gentrification that focus on changes in the relationships between different people and neighborhoods in the city over time, rather than on the inherent or internal characteristics of neighborhoods themselves. Ultimately, this presentation points towards the need for continued experimentations with emerging data sources, analytical techniques and geographic theories to better understand the ever-evolving landscape of socio-spatial inequality in the world today.\nSpeaker: Taylor Shelton, Georgia State University, taylorshelton.info, @kyjts.\nBio: Dr. Taylor Shelton is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Georgia State University. Working at the intersection of critical human geography and geographic information science, Dr. Shelton is interested in how urban spaces and social inequalities are represented, reproduced and contested through maps and data. In particular, his work focuses on using mapping and data visualization to develop alternative understandings of urban inequalities, especially in relation to issues of housing speculation, property ownership and neighborhood segregation. Prior to joining Georgia State in 2020, Dr. Shelton held appointments at Mississippi State University, the University of Kentucky and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before that, Dr. Shelton earned BA and MA degrees in geography from the University of Kentucky and his PhD from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University. Dr Shelton’s work can be found at taylorshelton.info and @kyjts."

Network analysis provides a different perspective on the world, through relations between people and places instead of the abstract space of GIS. This provides an exciting opportunity to break free(er) from the well-known constraints of the Cartesian grid common to most spatial techniques. Thrust forward by new types of geographical data and computational power, this combination of spatial + network analysis is especially incisive when applied to analyses of urban processes. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the diverging and converging histories of spatial and network analysis. I will then illustrate the current use and potential of network analytical methods in geography by drawing on my recent work on urban neighborhoods and systems.\nAte Poorthuis is an Assistant Professor of Big Data and Human-Environment Systems in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at KU Leuven. His research explores the possibilities and limitations of big data, through quantitative analysis and visualization, to better understand how our cities work. He has particular interest in the practical application of these academic insights within urban planning and policy.

With the increased availability of these data, it is becoming apparent that the value of “big data” lies not necessarily in its size, but in its heterogeneity.  As recent progress in data analytics and ambient intelligence is met with sensor-enabled mobile technology, geographic information science has pushed beyond “spatial” to incorporate non-explicitly geospatial contextual data.  This heterogeneous “digital exhaust” has led us to develop computational, data-driven models of human behaviour and take a multi-dimensional approach to investigating “place” and the activities people carry out at places.  In this talk, Prof. Grant McKenzie will champion this move towards Platial data science through his research on reverse geocoding, language-based tourist attraction similarity, and shared micro-mobility services.\nBio: Grant McKenzie is an assistant professor in the Department of Geography at McGill University in Montreal, Canada where he leads the Platial Analysis Lab, an interdisciplinary research group that works at the intersection of data science and behavioural geography. Much of Dr. McKenzie’s work examines how human activities vary within and between local neighborhoods and global communities. This has driven his applied interests in financial accessibility, geo-privacy, and micro-mobility services as well as the broader role that geospatial data science plays at the intersection of information technologies and society. Grant is a founding member of the Seattle-based start-up consultancy Spatial Development International and has worked as a data scientist and software developer for a range of NGOs and leading technology companies."

Whilst restrictions have since eased in the UK, a simple return to pre-pandemic travel behaviour is unlikely. In order to support public transport authorities and operators in providing an inclusive public transport system that meets the needs of users, the field requires continued research into changes in public transport patronage by different population groups throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUsing smart card travel data, we analyse demand for bus services during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the groups of the older population that continued to use public transport services during lockdown periods and that quickly returned to public transport when restrictions were eased. We compare these trends according to demographic characteristics of passengers as well as accessibility.\nBiography: Alfie Long is currently a PhD Student at UCL Department of Geography. His research is aimed at developing existing public transport big data infrastructure into simpler data formats that can be used to analyse the social equity of public transport mobilities.\nAnalysing the Impacts of Lockdown Restrictions on the London Bicycle Sharing System\nBy James Todd\nAbstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused large scale disruptions to the daily lives of billions around the world. This is primarily a result of the implementation of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI), in its various forms, by local and national governing bodies to help minimise the spread of the virus. In the most severe cases lockdown restrictions were imposed on populations, forcing them to quarantine within their own homes except for limited and specific purposes. Within this analysis we aim to quantify the impacts of these lockdown restrictions on the activity patterns observed within the docked London bicycle sharing system. Employing network and statistical analysis methods this work presents novel insights into the changes in cycling behaviour observed spatially, temporally and at a system-wide scale.\nBiography: James is currently an Associate Lecturer and Ph.D. student within the Department of Geography at UCL. His research aims to analyse the utility and validity of new urban mobility data sources in helping to understand movement trends for Smart City applications. Over the past few years, James has worked extensively with bicycle sharing system data from over 600 cities, exploiting dock capacity information to create comparative heuristics."
