The **RGS-IBG GIScience Research Group** offers a prize for the **best** **dissertation** in any area of geographic information science, which includes the application of existing techniques or the development of new ones in physical, human or environmental studies.

Entries are limited to postgraduate students completing GIScience-related MSc in higher education institutions in the UK and Ireland, and must be nominated by a member of staff within those institutions. Each institution is limited to a **single entry**.

Prizes are usually £100 plus Annual RGS-IBG Postgraduate Fellowship with £50 plus an Annual RGS-IBG Postgraduate Fellowship for the runner up.
