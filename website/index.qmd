title: "About us"
---

The **GIScience Research Group (GIScRG)** at the [Royal Geographical Society with IBG](https://www.rgs.org) is a [group of academics and practitioners](https://geoinfo.science/committee/) interested in promoting GIScience, Geographic Data Science and GI Technology in geographical research, teaching and the workplace.

We also support and promote e-science and the application of novel computing and spatial analysis paradigms to geographical systems, for example, agent-based modelling.

Contact us at _giscience.rgs \[at\] gmail.com_ for inquiries.
