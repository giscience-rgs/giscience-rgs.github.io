The GIScRG welcomes sessions that focus on, but not limited to:

- Reproducibility and open science
- Mapping, cartography and information visualisation
- Spatial analysis and uncertainty

    - Machine learning
    - Agent-based modelling
    - Natural language processing
    - Information retrieval

We are also open to co-sponsorships with other Research Groups.

Obtaining a group sponsorship for your session is not required, but it will connect your session to the broader GIScience community of the RGS-IBG. We will promote your session along with the other sessions we sponsor, providing your session with broader publicity. The session will be part of our AIC programme, thus avoiding overlaps with other GIScience sessions. Please note, however, that sponsorships do not include financial support, although you might be able to apply for a guest pass.

Please send the information below to _giscience.rgs \[at\] gmail.com_ before **February 12th**.

- Session organisers’ name, affiliation and email
- Session format and how many timeslots you are requiring
