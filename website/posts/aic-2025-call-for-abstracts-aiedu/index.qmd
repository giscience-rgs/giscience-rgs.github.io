## Call for abstracts

Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) draws from across
disciplinary domains in that it situates itself in data science,
environmental science and geography. It incorporates multi-modal
geospatial data to inform use cases in policy such as environmental
degradation and disaster management.

This session aims to explore these and other cross-disciplinary
interstices among big data, large language models, Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) and cartography. GIS education, which combines
spatial analysis and cartographic design, represents a unique context in
which Generative Artificial Intelligence tools can make a significant
impact.

GIS education encompasses a variety of pedagogical approaches aimed at
building both technical proficiency and spatial thinking (Duarte et al.
2022). Traditional methods are often complemented by laboratory-based
learning, where students engage in hands-on exercises with GIS software
like ArcGIS or QGIS, developing skills in spatial data manipulation,
analysis, and visualization (Rickles and Ellul, 2015).

Contemporary approaches have integrated emerging technologies and
pedagogies. For example, experiential learning incorporates fieldwork,
enabling students to gather spatial data using GPS devices or drones.
Additionally, the rise of WebGIS platforms and open data has
democratized GIS education, making geospatial tools and datasets
accessible to broader audiences (Ruibo, 2019).

This session is inspired by Muehlenhaus's cartographically-focussed
Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT). It is envisaged that papers
will represent a diversity of methodological stances: qualitative
studies and preliminary explorations are particularly encouraged.

Possible topics include (but are not limited to):

-   Descriptions and case studies of GeoAI and / or large language
    models to GIS and cartography / cartographic education;

-   Examples of how geographical epistemologies have shaped and / or
    been shaped by the application of (what might loosely be termed as)
    AI agents / AI tools;

-   Methodological approaches to such investigations; and

-   Defining and designing for the nurturing of literacies of GeoAI and
    the ethical implications of the use of IoT and Data Science in such
    investigations.
