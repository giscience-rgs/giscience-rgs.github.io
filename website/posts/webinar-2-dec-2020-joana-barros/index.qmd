**Abstract**: Urban inequalities are one of the greatest challenges in cities around the world. Identifying, quantifying and mapping inequalities are paramount for the understanding of their dynamics and the development of policies to both prevent and combat them. The talks will give an overview of a series of research projects that use geotechnologies to study urban inequalities, with examples of studies on segregation and accessibility in São Paulo and Rio (Brazil) and London (UK).

**Speaker**: Dr Joana Barros, Senior Lecturer in Geographic Information Science, Department of Geography, Birkbeck, University of London • http://www.bbk.ac.uk/geography/our-staff/full-time-academic-staff/barros[](http://www.bbk.ac.uk/geography/our-staff/full-time-academic-staff/barros)
